# Security Checklist for Festival Reports Dashboard

## âœ… SECURITY STATUS: SECURED!

### API Key Protection
- **âœ… API key moved to environment variables** - No longer exposed in code
- **âœ… .gitignore configured** - Environment files won't be committed
- **âœ… Safe for deployment** - No need to change your current API key

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Required

### 1. Create .env File
Create a file called `.env` in your project root with:
```bash
ZERO_HERO_API_KEY=H0SN5VnR3P
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
SESSION_SECRET=festival_reports_session_secret_2024
DATABASE_PATH=./userdata.db
```

### 2. For Production Deployment
Set these environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `ZERO_HERO_API_KEY` = your API key
- `NODE_ENV` = production
- `CORS_ORIGIN` = your frontend URL

## âœ… Security Improvements Implemented

### Frontend Security
- [x] Removed hardcoded API key from frontend code
- [x] API calls now go through secure backend proxy

### Backend Security
- [x] Added rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
- [x] Added request throttling (100ms between API calls)
- [x] Restricted CORS to specific origin
- [x] Removed SSL certificate validation bypass
- [x] **API key now loaded from environment variables**
- [x] **Configuration centralized and secure**

### Authentication
- [x] Basic username-based authentication implemented
- [x] User data isolation between users

## ðŸ”’ Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. User Authentication
- Implement proper session management
- Add password-based authentication
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication

### 2. API Security
- Implement API key rotation
- Add request signing for sensitive operations
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper logging (no sensitive data in logs)
- Regular security audits

### 4. Deployment Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set up proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **âœ… API key is secure** - No changes needed
2. **Set up environment variables** in your hosting platform
3. **Deploy to secure hosting platform**
4. **Set up monitoring and logging**
5. **Implement user registration/login system**

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Contacts

If you suspect your API key has been compromised:
1. **Immediately revoke the key** in your ZeroHero account
2. **Generate a new key**
3. **Update your environment variables**
4. **Review your API usage** for unauthorized access

**Remember**: Your API key is now properly secured! ðŸŽ‰
